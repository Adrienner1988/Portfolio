                <p>Hi, my name is Adrienne Daniels, welcome to my portfolio, and thank you for taking to opportunity to get to know me better. I have spent over 15 years in the hospitality industry and during my time at the University of North Florida in Jacksonville, Florida, I started my journey serving tables. After graduation, I moved to Atlanta, Georgia, and continued in hospitality as a marketing manager for a restaurant. I soon became a service manager before working in event planning and coordination for several years. Like many, the pandemic uprooted my life and I relocated back to Florida where I am currently working in radio in sales support.</p>

                  <p>I decided to become a developer because I wanted more fulfilling work and to use previously learned skills in a different way and learn new ones. I needed something new, and challenging, and that allowed me to use my creativity, I found that in developing. It makes me use my mind in a different way and hone in on old skills sharpening them. I have spent the last 2 years teaching myself how to code, but I was always looking for structure, help to understand some complex ideas and community, and ultimately I decided to join a coding bootcamp. I’m looking forward to learning and challenging myself like never before on this developing path.

                In my spare time, I enjoy rollerskating and learning dance moves on my skates. I have been skating for about 6 years, dance skating for 3. It takes many hours of practice, falling, failing, but mostly dedication to master a move or skill, although it can always be improved in some way. It is a forever student type of dedication. Being apart of the roller skating community, has been a great way to meet new people and make new friends over the years, as well as learn and teach skills.  When I am not skating I also enjoy various forms of entertainment, my favorite is true crime podcasts and shows. When I am not consuming true crime, I enjoy action movies, musicals and period films as well as other forms of the arts. When possible I travel to the farthest being Dubai.
